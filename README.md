# unit-4-game

* Description *
Gem collector game is a game built using html, css and javascript. A random number

is selected and assigned as the target number the user must hit during the game.

The number is select by using Math.Floor(Math.Random) and assigned to a variable.

Click events were created using jQuery, upon clicking an image of a gem, a new

random number is generated. The user can click until the either match the random

number or lose, at that point an alert will be made notifying the user if they've

won or lost. There is also a tally of total wins and losses.

* Goal *
This project is intended to display the front end skills I've learned so far 

including HTML, CSS (bootstrap), and javascript.
